The Pixel phones also help it get into the wearable segment and become the first major company to launch a standalone smartwatch.\\n\\nWith the new Google Pixel 7, Google is taking a modular approach with hardware — the company built Pixel Stand instead of relying on an accessory case, and the Pixel 7 is built for modularity by having both wireless and USB charging cables inside the phone.

It is cleaner than coal on a per-unit basis because it does not produce as much carbon, but still emits more than wind or solar power because of its sulfur content. The industry uses sulfur to prevent its natural gas from leaking out of pipes, and there is no substitute for this natural feature of the molecule. Sulfur also helps prevent combustion of natural gas from smoky.\\n\\nIn fact, the use of sulfur, which has been growing steadily since it was introduced decades ago, is one of the key differences between the United States and the rest of the world, says Charles Altermatt, chief executive of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. �', 'As they seek to reduce their carbon footprint, power plants around the world are increasingly replacing coal with natural gas, which releases far less carbon into the atmosphere when burned for fuel. But some have begun investigating other ways to burn it—and the results have been startling. As an alternative to gas, scientists are investigating a “carbon sponge” known as graphene that can absorb and store more than 15 times the amount of carbon released by natural gas and even coal, according to a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In doing so, these gases could help stabilize climate change.\\n\\nWhile natural gas and coal are still the dominant sources of electricity worldwide, they are increasingly under pressure for their impact on the environment, as fossil-fuel-fired power stations have been shown to contribute as much as 35 percent of global emissions of methane and carbon dioxide. In addition, they are extremely fuel-intensive and their global reliance has had a dramatic impact on the price of natural gas. A report by the US energy department in January found that by 2030, coal will be the cheapest way to generate power.\\n\\nAs this happens, a number of researchers are working to find an alternative to fossil fuels, which emit large amounts of carbon during combustion, and some are investigating graphene as a potential replacement. “We’re trying to find some sort of new way to produce power, or at least reduce our dependence on coal,” says Alyss', 'As they seek to reduce their carbon footprint, power plants around the world are increasingly replacing coal with natural gas, which releases far less carbon into the atmosphere when burned for fuel.\\n\\nBut gas-fired power plants produce far less carbon-free electricity. If all coal- and gas-fired plants were replaced with gas, the global average carbon dioxide emissions would increase by around 10 percent, from their current level of about 7.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to a recent study by the Global Carbon Project.\\n\\nThat shift could increase power bills and threaten the competitiveness of clean-energy industries. And it may even mean that the world will miss an important climate change opportunity, researchers warn.\\n\\n“If you have a lot of coal and a lot of gas, and you suddenly add in a lot of gas, you’re not going to see anywhere near the same environmental benefits as if you have a lot of coal and only gas,” said Michael Wara, director of Stanford University’s School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences.\\n\\nThe problem is that gas isn’t as clean as some people claim, either in terms of its carbon emissions or its potential to pollute local air and water supplies, Wara said.\\n\\n“It’s not a benign transition,” he said.\\n\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy in 2016 said that gas power plant', 'As they seek to reduce their carbon footprint, power plants around the world are increasingly replacing coal with natural gas, which releases far less carbon into the atmosphere when burned for fuel.\\n\\nBut in order to replace coal with natural gas, power plants need to burn natural gas in a way that makes it possible for them to capture the emissions that they otherwise would release, and bury them, without burning more natural gas.\\n\\nIn China, for instance, the replacement of coal with natural gas has allowed the country to reduce its carbon emissions. Last year, China’s carbon emissions were 17 percent lower than they were a year earlier. In 2017, natural gas accounted for more than half of the reduction in carbon emissions.\\n\\nThe United States is well on its way to adopting a similar energy mix, and some experts predict that the shift to natural gas will continue, despite a push by some environmentalists to slow the transition by pushing for a tax on carbon emissions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to eliminate rules that were designed to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases that power plants are allowed to emit, a regulation known as the Clean Air Act.
